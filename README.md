## Features
- Identify various types of credentials, including API keys, passwords, usernames, phone numbers, and more.
- Download and scan JavaScript files from provided URLs.
- Scan all `.js` files within a specified directory.
- Multithreaded scanning for faster performance.
- Save scan results to a file.
- Verbose mode for detailed logging.
